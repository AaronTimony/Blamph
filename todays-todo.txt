2) Check issues with tokenization + translation and see what can be done to improve. I can also check like if the words are really being caught by my algorithm accurately by looking at subs then at the tokenization.

3) Fix SRS system make something more meaningful with better review intervals and more complexity.

8) So I also need a system where when a word is searched, there are several options for what word and then when you click on the word you get much more details. I can add all those details to the word later.

14) Authorizations
16) Recreate user_cards with partitions.
17) ui and ux, git actions, typescript?
23) add html closers byautomatically.
26) Allow to sort deck words by different thing like frequency, overall_frequency, order in show. In order to do this need to create like a settings tab.
27) Add to the review tab the search bar. Then make a nice formatting for those search results (I think going with same formatting as in deck details is good). Ensure search finds english and japanese like other page.
28) Perhaps add stats page, like number of words reviewed today, 7 days, all time. Also add number of words known and stuff to that page instead. Change logout button to username with dropdown and options to go to options, stats etc.
29) Also add in settings a way for users to choose the number of daily words they would like to do (new ones).
30) NEED TO FIX CACHE ISSUES WHEN CHANGIN PFP CACHE NEEDS TO BE INVALIDATED. WE NEED TO REMOVE THE ENDPOINT FROM SOURCE AND CREATE FNC WITH ONSUCCESS INVALIDATION OF CACHE.
