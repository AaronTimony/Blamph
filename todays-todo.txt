1) Add site-wide frequency and all words on site. So just have card - frequency button on search page.
2) Check issues with tokenization + translation and see what can be done to improve.
3) Fix SRS system make something more meaningful with better review intervals and more complexity.
5) I need to fix my frontend as well. Pages should JUST contain components and not have all the code that should be in the components. Need to fix that.
6) Inspect code and see if there are any unncessary parts that could be fixed or optimized. Perhaps look at other people's code for ideas and learn some stuff.
7) Allow for users to create custom decks with their uploaded subtitles (gives meaning to create deck). I need to add a way to add images to the deck manually and if user doesn't have a deck just have a book or something show up.
8) So I also need a system where when a word is searched, there are several options for what word and then when you click on the word you get much more details. I can add all those details to the word later.
9) Possible mismatch in true number of words and unique words count. Need to check if they are accurate.
10) Still one bug with refresh tokens where you get logged out until you click something that calls an api and then you get re-logged.
11) katakana words dont need to have readings.
12) Add feature so click on a deck gives frequencies and words of deck.
13) if word exist in subtitle_parser add to some site-wide frequency counter for the word(must be added currently doesnt exist.)
14) Authorization
15) I need to record known word %.
