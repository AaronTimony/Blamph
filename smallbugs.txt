4) When you drag the deck to the bottom in my decks it just stays permanently scrolling downwards.
10) When you add a deck while searching, it doesn't disappear. Kind of important. Looks like on the decks page you can search all decks including the ones you already have added which is a bit worrying possibly.
11) The known, unique words and words dont add up. Need to see whats going on
12) I might already have this down, but when I load up the review home page, I shoul dhave it refetch the new words to learn immediately. Further, once I do my first review, I should refetch the review home page queries.
13) I have an issue where once a card is saved to that front page thing and displayed, even if new review cards come it doesn't reset. 
14) When you log in, have some kind of loading before going to main page. Do same for registration.
15) Clean up adding and deleting decks its very slow and i think i know why. When i import useDecks and stuff it runs too much rather than just calling one api. Separate hooks
16) Need to speed up creating decks by a lot lol.
17) Parser can only take a limited number of bytes! Big problemo!
18) need to clear cache of decks on logout
19) Prompt signin on add deck of logged out screen for decks
20) need to add loading screen for login and registration
21) I believe since I made changes to user reg, ONLY new words are being shown in new words for a deck.
