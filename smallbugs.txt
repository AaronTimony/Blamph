1) When you drag the deck to the bottom in my decks it just stays permanently scrolling downwards.
2) When you add a deck while searching, it doesn't disappear. Kind of important. Looks like on the decks page you can search all decks including the ones you already have added which is a bit worrying possibly.
3) The known, unique words and words dont add up. Need to see whats going on
4) I might already have this down, but when I load up the review home page, I shoul dhave it refetch the new words to learn immediately. Further, once I do my first review, I should refetch the review home page queries.
5) I have an issue where once a card is saved to that front page thing and displayed, even if new review cards come it doesn't reset. 
6) Parser can only take a limited number of bytes! Big problemo!
7) need to clear cache of decks on logout
8) The review words do not wait for new words and instead flash the next word rather than waiting.
9) Need to improve the responsiveness at small sizes in review. For example megane is going off the screen so i need it to wrap
