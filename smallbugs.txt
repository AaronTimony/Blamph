10) When you add a deck while searching, it doesn't disappear. Kind of important. Looks like on the decks page you can search all decks including the ones you already have added which is a bit worrying possibly.
11) The known, unique words and words dont add up. Need to see whats going on
12) I might already have this down, but when I load up the review home page, I shoul dhave it refetch the new words to learn immediately. Further, once I do my first review, I should refetch the review home page queries.
13) I have an issue where once a card is saved to that front page thing and displayed, even if new review cards come it doesn't reset. 
14) When you log in, have some kind of loading before going to main page. Do same for registration.
