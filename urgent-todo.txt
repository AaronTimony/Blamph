1) Forget all that other shit for now. I need to fix this site at its foundation.
Improve UX first:
- When I load into the webiste, I first join logged out until i do something. I need to fix that so that It always works if you have a refresh token.

2) Recreate user_cards with partitions.

4) Create some way for new users to enter the site, create and Account and then login nice and seemlessly. Explain the sites goal on purpose when users first enter.
